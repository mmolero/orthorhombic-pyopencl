if you use orthorhombic-pyopencl code in your research, we would appreciate the citation of the following article:

"Accelerating numerical modeling of wave propagation through 2-D anisotropic materials using OpenCL", Miguel Molero & Ursula Iturrar√°n-Viveros, Ultrasonics (Accepted in November 2012)


Version 0.10: 01/09/2012

In order to run the present code you need the following open-source software: Python (we use version 2.7.3), NumPy, Matplotlib, Scipy, PyOpenCL (OpenCL Library). 

To run the code you just have to type: python main.py (run main SR.py for a single angle) and this will invoke de ANI2D class and all its necessary constructors to start with the time loop. 

There is a complementary file called ANI2D Classes.py that contains the classes for the source, the inspection, the material and the model rotation.
